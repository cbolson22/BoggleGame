# Boggle Game

A Java-based implementation of the Boggle game with a graphical interface using the ACM library.

I made this game in a highschool computer science class in 2021.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.
- [ACM Library](https://jtf.acm.org/) included in the `lib` folder.

## Project Structure

- `lib/`: Contains the ACM library (`acm.jar`).

- `sounds/`: Contains sound files used in the game.
  - `bounce.wav`: Played when an already-found word is selected.
  - `sfx-cartoons10.wav`: Played when a new valid word is found.

- `src/`: Contains the source code (`Boggle.java`, `BoggleGraphics.java`, `BoggleGrid.java`).

- `bogwords.txt`: Dictionary file with valid words.


## How to Run

### Using VS Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cbolson22/BoggleGame.git
